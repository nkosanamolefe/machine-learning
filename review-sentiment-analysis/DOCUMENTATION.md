## Measuring Guest Satisfaction Over Time
### Problem statement
Hosts often lack a systematic way to measure how satisfied guests are over time.
### Objective of the project
To develop a systematic method for measuring guest satisfaction over time by analyzing sentiment from Airbnb reviews. This will enable hosts to track changes in guest satisfaction, assess the impact of improvements or changes made to their properties or services, and make data-driven decisions to enhance guest experiences.
### Project Environment
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Data Storage**: SQLite, PostgreSQL, or cloud-based databases (e.g., AWS RDS)
- **Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI, Dash, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Cloud Platform**: optional for deployment
